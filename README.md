A web server application that can be compiled for your operating system to provide distributed website hosting experience on your set of computers locally.
Though not optimised for industry level applications, this provides an innovative laboratory for understanding web application servers and traffic management. 

- There is support for various languages via their original interpreters, such as PHP, Node, DJango, .NET, Springboot and GO. 
- Database support can be enabled for MongoDB, MySQL
- Available internet protocols include  HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, UDP, NTP
- Note: The HTTPS certificate is not professional and has to be configured by the website owner, otherrwise a self made certificate can be installed onto the browsers.
- There are multiple visions for this project, not all exclusive nor all innovative. Some of them are AI enhanced server and application security, terminal based control, SSH enabled control, plugin support, native app for ARM architectures, et cetera.
